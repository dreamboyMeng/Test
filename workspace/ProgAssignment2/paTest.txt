For the System Under Design to move the XML data instance Claim_Case_1 and
XSL style sheet together through the workflow #PW23 with department=3, the
XSL used for the transform is referenced from within the XML and a 1-1
association is created within the database between the XML instance and the
respective style sheet.  Since a single XSL can be used many times, the XSL
style sheets are distinctly versioned within the system under design 
(version=10) and the specific version used to create the document is noted in
the XML and the database association between the XML data set and the XSL
style sheet.
